I am a Research Fellow(Feb. 2021 â€“ present) in Duke-NUS, Singapore. 

My research delves into the analysis of ultrahigh-dimensional data using latent factor models, with a focus on nonlinear dimension reduction and (online) missing value imputation, and the corresponding theoretical underpinnings. Additionally, I design statistical and computational methodologies for the interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data collected via cutting-edge sequencing techniques. I am deeply passionate about these research areas due to their potential for significant impact on fields such as social and behavioral sciences, economy and finance, and genomics.
