<h1>Markov random field</h1>
<p>A Markov random field(MRF) is an undirected graphical model that explicitly expresses the conditional independence relationships between nodes. Two nodes are conditionally independent if all paths between them are blocked by given nodes. Thus, assume <span class="math inline">\(X_i,i\in S\)</span> is a MRF, then <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is independent of all other <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> given the neighbors <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Hidden markov model</h1>
<p>Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process – call it <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> – with unobservable (“hidden”) states. HMM assumes that there is another process <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> whose behavior “depends” on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. The goal is to learn about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by observing <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X_{n}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{n}\)</span> be discrete-time stochastic processes and <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 1\)</span>. The pair <span class="math inline">\((X_{n},Y_{n})\)</span> is a hidden markov model if</p>
<p>1)<span class="math inline">\(X_{n}\)</span> is a Markov process whose behavior is not directly observable (“hidden”);</p>
<p>2)<span class="math inline">\(P(Y_n \in A|X_1=x_1, \cdots, X_n=x_n)=P(Y_n \in A|X_n=x_n),\)</span>
for every <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 1, x_1,\cdots,x_n\)</span> and an arbitrary (measurable) set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Terminology:
The states of the process <span class="math inline">\(X_{n}\)</span> are called hidden states, and <span class="math inline">\(P(Y_n\in A|X_n=x_n)\)</span> is called emission probability or output probability.</p>

<h1>Hidden Markov random field</h1>
<p>In statistics, a hidden Markov random field is a generalization of a hidden Markov model. Instead of having an underlying Markov chain, hidden Markov random fields have an underlying Markov random field.</p>
<p>Suppose that we observe a random field (variable) <span class="math inline">\(Y_i, i\in S\)</span>. HMRFs assume that the probabilistic nature of <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is determined by the unobservable Markov random field <span class="math inline">\(X_i,i \in S\)</span>. That is, given the neighbors <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is independent of all other <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span>(Markov property). The main difference with a HMM is that neighborhood is not defined in 1 dimension but within a network, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is allowed to have more than the two neighbors but a Markov chiain has no more than two. HMRF model is formulated in such a way that given <span class="math inline">\(X_i, Y_i\)</span> are independent, i.e. 
<span class="math display">\[P(Y|X)=\Pi_{i=1}^nP(Y_i|X_i).\]</span></p>
