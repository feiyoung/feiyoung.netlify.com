<h1>Summary, 2021-01-29</h1>
<p>The aims or problmes are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Write a R package to implement the algorithm about the estimation of the current model;</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the performance of three methods: 1)the Proposed, 2) conducting GMM after PCA dimension reduction, and 3) conducting GMM on the latent variable, where GMM denotes Gaussian mixture model.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the model settings and simulation results into a document, and viualization is preferred. Model settings include that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is set as <span class="math inline">\(1000, 2000\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is set as <span class="math inline">\(2000, 4000\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is set as <span class="math inline">\(2, 4, 6\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot the estimates of latent variables <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the method of data preprocessing and Yang Yi Shixiong can provide somde demo codes and real data.</p></li>
<li><p>Read some papers about the area of Single-cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about adding the Hidden Gaussian Markov fields into model, then use ICM algorithm to implement it.</p></li>
</ol>
